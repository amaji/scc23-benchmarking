Benchmarking interview and grading
----------------------------------
This year, the benchmark judges will interview each SCC23 team between 1:00 PM MDT and 3:00 PM MDT on Nov 13, 2023 and ask them questions about their cluster configurations and the benchmarks. 
The objective of the interview is to get a comprehensive overview of the clusters and understand each team's tuning methodology.

The overall benchamrking score for a team will depend on multiple factors such as the output obtained for each benchmark, the benchmarking interview, and the team's adherence to the rules set 
by the SCC committee. The core benchamrks and the secondary benchmarks will carry approximately ``95%`` and ``5%`` weights respectively.
