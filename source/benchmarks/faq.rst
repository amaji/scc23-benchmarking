Frequently asked questions
----------------------------------

  - When should we inform the SCC committee about code modifications to the benchmark source codes?
  
    If you modify the source codes for any of the benchmark applications, such modifications should be communicated to the SCC23 committee by Oct 31, 2023. 
    This is to make sure that the committee has sufficient time to review and approve the changes. Code modifications after this date *may* be allowed by the SCC
    committee only in exceptional circumstances.

  - We have novel hardware for which X benchmark has not been optimized. How can we still be competitive with other teams?

    Your raw benchmark output constitutes a fraction of your benchmarking score. You will also be evaluated on your performance during the interview, your overall methodology,
    and your contributions to the community. The benchmarking judges will make every effort to perform fair comparisons across different hardware.
