MLPerf rules and validation
---------------------------

The instructions to run the MLPerf BERT inference benchmark and submit your results 
can be found in `this tutorial <https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/tutorials/scc23-mlperf-inference-bert.md>`_. 

Note that MLPerf writes both to `stdout` and `stderr` - you will need to capture both streams for your submission.
