MLPerf Rules and Validation
---------------------------

The MLPerf benchmark instructions are at https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/tutorials/sc22-scc-mlperf.md

The MLPerf benchmark this year is optional, and for bonus points. You will get the bonus points even if the certification you run it in is not your final certification.
